# Stytch Management API OpenAPI Specification

This repository contains the OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification for Stytch's Management API (Programmatic Workspace Actions).

## About the Management API

The Stytch Management API allows you to programmatically manage your Stytch workspace resources, including:

- Projects and Environments
- Secrets and Public Tokens
- Email Templates
- RBAC Policies
- JWT Templates
- Password Strength Configuration
- Redirect URLs
- SDK Configuration
- Country Code Allowlists
- Event Log Streaming
- Trusted Token Profiles
- Environment Metrics

## API Credentials

To use the Management API, you'll need your Management API credentials from the workspace management section of your [Stytch Dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/settings/management-api).

**Note:** Management API credentials allow read and write actions on your workspace, potentially deleting important Stytch resources like projects or secrets that are in use.
